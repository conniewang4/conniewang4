    <h3>Abortion For All aims to educate not only women that are now put in potential danger and risk of having their lives forcibly changed, but also everyone in America. This is because abortion has a larger and broader effect than many people think. Our goal is to inform the public and take action to do everything we can to support abortion rights.</h3>
